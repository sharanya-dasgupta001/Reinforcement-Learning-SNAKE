# Reinforcement-Learning-SNAKE
- This project focuses on training an AI agent to play the classic Snake game using reinforcement learning (RL).
- The agent learns by interacting with the game environment, where it receives rewards for actions that increase its score and penalties for actions that result in failure.
- The goal is to optimize the agentâ€™s behavior through trial and error using Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
